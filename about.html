					<p>
						Don't-mestic violence is founded on the principle of educating the youth to identify and remove themselves from or help stop situations of domestic violence. We do this by offering classes, through our website, and by providing safety shelters, transportation, and protection to those in need. By providing education on domestic violence, it will be possible to transform society.
					</p>
					<p>
						The objective of Don't-mestic Violence is to educate the youth to identify and defeat domestic violence, provide resources for victims and survivors, and to bring awareness to the normalization of domestic violence. Don't-mestic Violence works alongside other organizations to provide shelters to protect victims and survivors of domestic violence, as well as medical treatment. We work to create a safety net for all victims of domestic violence.

					<p>
						Don't-mestic Violence started as a small company at Stony Brook University after the idea was conceived for the LDS 101 project in fall of 2018. The project was created by 4 freshmen students as a fictional organization.
