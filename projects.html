					<h3 class="pageheader">Public Safety Shelter Project</h3> 
					<p>
						In 2018, Don’t-mestic Violence began its public safety shelter project. The goal was to have shelters in as many cities and available to as many people as possible. Through collaboration with other organizations and institutions, there are currently 163 shelters available in 23 states, with more being added to the list every month by both Don’t-mestic Violence and other organizations. Shelters provide a food and shelter, medical treatment, therapy sessions, free phone calls, access to free transportation to and from the shelter, and protection by an escort when necessary. The shelters will also help in providing victims with a safe legal route for restraining orders or prosecution when necessary.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to get access to these resources, visit, call, text, or email the nearest safety shelter, or contact us.

					<h3 class="pageheader">Online Classes and Lessons</h3> 
					<p>
						Don’t-mestic Violence begun providing online classes to those looking to learn more about how to identify and stop domestic violence in late 2018. These include lessons on de-escalation, the signs of domestic violence, and what to do to help others experiencing domestic violence.
