					<h4 class="pageheader">What is domestic violence?</h4> 
					<p class="indent">
						Domestic violence is violence or abuse inflicted in a domestic setting (i.e. at home), such as in a marriage, between spouses, between parents or guardians and their children, or between partners in an intimate relationship. In the case of an intimate relationship between partners or spouses, it may be called intimate partner violence.
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						Domestic violence in the United States is a term used to refer to felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former partner or guardian. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ovw/domestic-violence">[1]</a>
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						Domestic violence takes many forms. It includes physical, verbal, and emotional abuse. Additional forms of abuse include economic abuse and sexual abuse.

					<h4 class="pageheader">What kinds of harm does domestic violence cause?</h4> 
					<p class="indent">
						Because there are many types of violence possible, the list of ways to harm someone is inexhaustible. Therefore it is more useful to list the most common types of violence with emphasis on those that are allowed or go unrecognized as unacceptable acts of domestic violence.
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						In some abusive relationships, the abuser will take control over the other person through isolation (e.g. lying to friends and family to make the victim lose favor), financial abuse (e.g. taking away money and make the victim financially dependant), through shame and fear, through physical abuse, or threat of harm to the victim or others (such as children).
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						As a result of domestic violence, victims may experience physical trauma that results in disabilities, such as blindness, broken bones or other injuries that may disqualify the victim from certain jobs, trauma to the brain that results in mental impairment, or disfigurement. Most will experience mental illness as a result of the abuse, that will interrup their ability to create and maintain relationships, or to be able to work and become financially stable.
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						Abuse can also result in limited financial capital, making it difficult for the victim to become financially stable or independent. This coupled with the mental illness caused by domestic violence and potential physical or mental disabilities can make it near impossible for some victims to regain independence.
