					<h4 class="pageheader">Types of domestic violence</h4> 
					<p class="indent">
						Before we can look for the signs of domestic violence, first we must identify what different types of domestic violence are.
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						Cases of domestic violence often start small and escalate. It may begin with intimidation, threats, or aggression, it may escalate quickly and result in physical or emotional harm that can cause permanent damage.
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						The most common type of domestic violence is physical abuse. This is the most obvious, and includes physical harm of any kind. It is most common that victims still in a relationship with their abuser will attempt to justify the actions of their partner or guardian. Any form of violence without provokation (they were hit or attacked first) is unwarranted and unjustified. 
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						Another common type of domestic violence is emotional abuse. This includes attempts to control the behavior or beliefs of the victim, like controlling the way the victim dresses or who they speak to, invasion of privacy, deprivation of personal time or space, monitoring of communication with others, or use of children as hostages or spies. None of these are justifiable.
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						One type of common emotional abuse is Gaslighting, in which the abuser attempts to make the victim believe that their memory and sanity are unreliable or that they are unstable, incompetent or weak. This is done when abuser provides some information to the victim, e.g. hangs a painting on the wall, changes it while the victim is not around, and then denies that anything had changed when the victim realizes that it had changed. The victim will think that it had changed, but because they were told by someone that they trust that it had not changed, they will begin to doubt their own memory and sanity. Over time this can make the victim believe that they are unreliable and rely more on the abuser.
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						A third common form of domestic violence is verbal abuse. This takes the form of insults that attempt to ruin the self confidence of the victim, or threats that create fear in the victim. 
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						Another common form of abuse is sexual abuse. This includes coersion through threats or other means, into sexual acts, or committing such acts through force. This also includes threats of such violence or abuse.
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						Another type still is finanial abuse. This may include stealing or "borrowing" of money without returning it, witholding of resources (e.g. not paying part of the rent, and asking the victim to pay it all, and not returning their portion), or taking out credit cards or loans in the victim's name to incur debt in order to chain the victim down.
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						Many of these types of domestic violence can be simplified. The majority of forms of domestic violence are threats (of violence, to hurt or kill the victim, self, children, pets, etc.), yelling, screaming or insults that attempt to create fear or doubt in the victim in order to have the victim submit to or trust the abuser so that the abuser can gain control over the victim. None should be tolerated.

					<h4 class="pageheader">How do I know if I am in an abusive relationship?</h4></h4> 
					<p class="indent">
						The first step to tell if you are in an abusive relationship is to know what domestic violence and an abusive relationship are. Since we have completed this part in this and the previous lesson, you should have some idea what constitutes domestic violence.
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						If you recognize any of these characteristics of domestic violence in your relationship with a spouse or partner, or from a parent or guardian, you may be a victim of domestic violence, or potentially a perpetrator.
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						If you do not recognize any of these signs, or believe that you are the one at fault, try recording events and interractions between you and your partner, parent, or guardian that seem suspicious to you. If afterwards you do recognize that you are in an abusive relationship, Lesson 3 will teach you how to exit an abusive relationship.
					</p>

				<div class="coverpage small green">
					<h4 class="pageheader">How do I know if someone else is in an abusive relationship?</h4></h4> 
					<p class="indent">
						The abuser in an abusive relationship will often times attempt to control the beliefs and actions of the victim. This can result in the inability of the other person to leave the abuser, and them becoming increasingly difficult to contact or interract with. Because two types of domestic violence are isolation and monitoring of communication, the victim may become unreachable, or you may not be able to meet with the victim because they are not allowed to by the abuser.
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						Another sign that someone is in an abusive relationship is wounds such as black eyes or bruises that are common and frequent. Victims may attempt to come up with excuses for the wounds, so asking alone may not be enough to have the person confess that they are being abused. They may change the type of clothes they wear because of emotional abuse or coersion, or because they wish to hide the evidensce of abuse.
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						Changes in the person's behavior, mood, or confidence may also be signs that the person is in an abusive relationship. This may be a result of verbal or emotional abuse by the abuser. It may also be the result of other causes, so this alone should not be the only factor in determining if someone is being abused.
